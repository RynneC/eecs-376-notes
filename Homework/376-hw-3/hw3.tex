    If applicable, state the name(s) and uniqname(s) of your collaborator(s).

    \question[10] \textbf{Self assessment.}
  
      Carefully read and understand the posted solutions to the previous homework.
      Identify one part for which your own solution has the most room for improvement (e.g., has unsound reasoning, doesn’t show what was required, could be significantly clearer or better organized, etc.).
      Copy or screenshot this solution, then in a few sentences, explain what was deficient and how it could be fixed.
    
      (Alternatively, if you think one of your solutions is significantly \emph{better} than the posted one, copy it here and explain why you think it is better.)

    \end{center}
    I think I did fair enough in hw 2, giving mostly correct answers, especially in the greedy algorithm part. I think I could have done better in the dynamic programming part. In problem 4, I took the fact that in the case when $A[i] = B[i]$, $ED(i-1, j-1)$ is the most efficient way but did not rigorously prove it. Next time I should think more carefully.

    \question \textbf{Decision Problems and Languages.} \textcolor{blue}{(L8)}
    
Recall that the goal of a \emph{decision problem} is to determine whether a given input ``object'' has a certain ``property'', e.g., determine whether a given integer is prime, or whether a given string is a palindrome.
  In class, we said that any decision problem is equivalent to a \emph{membership problem} for a corresponding \emph{language}.
  That is, determining whether a given object has the property is equivalent to determining whether its encoding (as a string) is a member of the language.

  For each of the following decision problems, (i)~define a reasonable (finite) alphabet~$\Sigma$, (ii)~give the encoding (over the alphabet) of a representative input object, (iii)~analyze the length of the encoding in terms of the value of the input, and (iv) define a language~$L$ for the corresponding decision problem.
  Use the notation~$\inner{X}$ for the encoding of object~$X$ as a string over the alphabet.
  As examples, we have provided solutions to the first two parts. 
    
  \begin{parts}
    \part \textbf{Example:} ``Does a given non-negative integer $k$ have 3 as its last digit, when written in base 10?''
    
    \begin{solution}
      \begin{enumerate}[(i)]
      \item A reasonable alphabet consists of the decimal digits, $\Sigma = \set{\texttt{0}, \ldots, \texttt{9}}$.
      Alternatively, we could use the binary digits $\bit$, or hexadecimal digits (0 through 9 and A through F), or the digits from any other base (including unary), or some entirely different-looking alphabet like $\set{\star, \otimes, \bot}$ (though the latter would not be very human-friendly).
      No matter the choice of (nonempty, finite) alphabet, there is a way to unambiguously encode (represent) non-negative integers as strings of characters from that alphabet.

      Note that it would \emph{not} be valid to include all of the non-negative integers in the alphabet, because an alphabet must be a \emph{finite} set, and there are infinitely many non-negative integers.

      \item Example encoding: For an integer $k$, write it in base 10 in the usual way, as a string of digits.
        For example, if $k$ is the integer forty-seven, then $\langle k \rangle = \texttt{47}$.
        We stress that this is a \emph{string} of the characters \texttt{4} and \texttt{7}, which \emph{represents} the number forty-seven.

      \item The length of this encoding would be the number of digits in the value, which is $\Theta(\log k)$.

      \item A corresponding language would be $L_{EndsWith3} = \set{\langle k \rangle : k \bmod 10 = 3}$.
        It would also be acceptable to copy the phrasing of the decision problem, i.e., $L_{EndsWith3} = \set{\langle k \rangle : k \text{ written in base 10 has 3 as the last digit}}$
      \end{enumerate}

      Alternatively, we could also encode integers in binary, using the alphabet $\Sigma=\set{0,1}$.
      For example, if $k=5$, then $\langle k \rangle = \texttt{101}$.
      The length of this encoding is still $\Theta (\log k)$.
      The above two definitions of the language hold without modification, because they both describe membership only in terms of the \emph{value} of~$k$, not its encoding.
    \end{solution}
    
    \part \textbf{Example:} ``Is a given array of non-negative integers sorted?''
    
    \begin{solution}
      \begin{enumerate}[(i)]
      \item A reasonable alphabet $\Sigma$ is the set of ASCII characters, or more selectively, the decimal digits along with some separator characters: $\Sigma = \set{\texttt{0}, \ldots, \texttt{9}, \texttt{[}, \texttt{,}, \texttt{]}}$.
        (Notice that a comma is one of these characters.)

        Note that we can't just use the decimal digits alone if we also want some special symbols to indicate the start/end of the array and to separate the elements.
          
      \item Example encoding: For an array $A$, encode its elements as in the previous part, and list those encodings with appropriate separators.
        For example, the array $A$ with entries one, two, three, and four would have $\langle A \rangle = \texttt{[1,2,3,4]}$.
      \item The length of this encoding is $\Theta(n + e)$, where~$n$ is the number of elements in the array, and $e$ is the total length of the encodings of the elements.
      \item The corresponding language is \[ L_\text{sorted} = \set{\langle A \rangle : A \text{ is a sorted array of non-negative integers.}}
          .
        \]
      \end{enumerate}
    \end{solution}
    
    \part [4] ``Given two strings compost of English alphabets, do they have a common subsequence of length $k$?''

    \begin{solution}
    \begin{enumerate}[(i)]
      \item A reasonable alphabet $\Sigma$ is the set of 26 English letters both in their upper and lower case forms, together with a quotation mark for : $\Sigma = \set{\texttt{a}, \ldots, \texttt{z}, \texttt{A}, \ldots, \texttt{Z}, \texttt{[}, \texttt{,}, \texttt{]}}$.  
      \item Example encoding: For an array $A$, encode its elements as in the previous part, and list those encodings with appropriate separators.
        For example, the array $A$ with entries one, two, three, and four would have $\langle A \rangle = \texttt{[1,2,3,4]}$.
      \item The length of this encoding is $\Theta(n + e)$, where~$n$ is the number of elements in the array, and $e$ is the total length of the encodings of the elements.
      \item The corresponding language is \[ L_\text{sorted} = \set{\langle A \rangle : A \text{ is a sorted array of non-negative integers.}}
          .
        \]

    \question \textbf{Decidability and Set Operations.} \textcolor{blue}{(L11)}
     
     Consider four languages where $L_{D1}$ and $L_{D2}$ are decidable, and $L_{U1}$ and $L_{U2}$ are undecidable. Determine whether the following languages are always/ sometimes/ never decidable. The case of $L_{D1} \cap L_{D2}$ is provided as an example. While justification is \textbf{not required} to received for full credit, providing it is highly encouraged.

     \begin{parts}
         \part \textbf{Example:} $L_A = L_{D1} \cap L_{D2}$

         \begin{solution}
             \textbf{Always.} Let $M_1$ be a TM that decides $L_{D1}$, and $M_2$ be a TM that decides $L_{D2}$. We use these to construct the following Turing Machine that decides $L_{D1}\cap L_{D2}$:
            \begin{center}
                \begin{minipage}{0.8\linewidth}
                    \begin{algorithm}[H]
                        \algorithmiconinput{$M'$}{($x$)}
                        \begin{algorithmic}[1]
                            \State Run $M_1$ on $x$ and run $M_2$ on $x$
                            \State \textbf{If} both $M_1$ and $M_2$ accepted $x$ \textbf{then} accept
                            \State \textbf{Else} reject
                        \end{algorithmic}
                    \end{algorithm}
                \end{minipage}
            \end{center}
            \textbf{Analysis:}
            \begin{itemize}
                \item $x \in (L_{D1} \cap L_{D2}) \implies x \in L_{D1} \land x \in L_{D2} \implies M_1 \text{ accepts } \land M_2 \text{ accepts } \implies M \text{ accepts}$
                \item $x \notin (L_{D1} \cap L_{D2}) \implies x \notin L_{D1} \lor x \notin L_{D2} \implies M_1 \text{ rejects } \lor M_2 \text{ rejects } \implies M \text{ rejects}$
            \end{itemize}
            Since $M_1$ and $M_2$ are deciders, they necessarily halt on all inputs. Thus, $M'$ must also halt on all inputs. In addition, since $M'$ accepts all $x \in (L_{D1} \cap L_{D2})$ and rejects all $x \notin (L_{D1} \cap L_{D2})$, it follows that $M'$ decides $L_{D1} \cap L_{D2}$. As we have constructed a decider for $(L_{D1} \cap L_{D2})$, we can conclude that $(L_{D1} \cap L_{D2})$ is necessarily decidable.
